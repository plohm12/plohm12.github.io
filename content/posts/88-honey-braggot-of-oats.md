  A collaboration with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/honeybeagle_meadery">HoneyBeagle Mead</a> for the <a href="https://meadstampede.org/">Mead Stampede</a> homebrew competition,
  this batch is half beer, half mead. We brewed an oatmeal stout, then blended that with over 7 lb. of Kukui blossom honey.
